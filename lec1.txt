====================================== GIT COMMANDS & USES ===============================================
1. git clone <url>-- it is used to download the files from the server or internet and download it to the computers.
                    if we give HTTPS URL Name then it will ask for our Git credentials but if we use public SSH key
                    in order to authenticate and it will not ask for any credentials.

# To keep tracking for the changes made to a file--
2.1 git add filename.extension : will track the mentioned file name, means it will save the changes made to it 
                                (better to say it will take snapshots of it and apply the changes once commited) 
                                but it will not commited yet. To make it commit we have another command.

# To tell the Get repository to save my sanpshot of the current state of the repository keeping track of any changes that 
  has been made to these files that i have added using git add--
2.2 git commit -m "message" : This message is known as commit message, it is description of what chnages we have made in this 
   most recent commit, because over time as we work on a big project, we are probably going to make lots of commits (means 
   lots of changes commit again and again) but i want  to refer back to previous commit, but it's only valuable to do so if you
   can identify in which commit you made a particular change.
   Example: git commit -m "I have added sum func and fib rcrsn func"

# to reflect our changes online:
The changes we were making above were only happening on our own computer not at the github repository, if i want to push those changes to 
GitHub then we gonna need additional command.

# first lets check our git status
3. git status: git run the program and tell me that
   Currently On branch master
   Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
   (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

# so to push the changes to server we will use "git push" command, so that they are reflected there:
4. git push: whatever changes we have made will be pushed to GitHub.

# if we want to all the files that have been changed and commit at same time, the shorthand is git comit -am
5. git commit -am : commit all the changes that have been made (-am : here a means all and m means also provide a message).
                    So we can combine "git add step" and "git commit step" into just single step. By saying commit all
                    of the files that have been changed, then i'll provide a message.
